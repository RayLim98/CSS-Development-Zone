# Goal
Goal of this repo is to create isolated css styles in multiple different ways and familiarize myself with the syntax. Styled componenets, tailwindcss and SASS are three different styling libraries I've across so far. I like all of em' as they have their own perks. Each css styling method will be in their own respective branch.
